                The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized how we interact with the world, generating vast amounts
                of data from connected devices. To effectively manage and analyze this data, specialized data
                engineering techniques are essential. In this workshop, we will delve into the realm of IoT data
                engineering, focusing on constructing robust data pipelines capable of tackling the unique challenges
                posed by IoT data. The primary objective of the workshop is to provide researchers and industrialists
                with an opportunity to learn about developing cutting-edge data solutions and to engage in stimulating
                discussions on the latest advancements in this field. </p>
